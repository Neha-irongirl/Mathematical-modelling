# Rational Fractal Spline

##  Introduction  
Rational Fractal Spline is an advanced interpolation technique in approximation theory, leveraging **fractal interpolation functions (FIFs)**. It is useful for modeling complex natural structures such as **mountain ranges, cloud tops, and forest horizons**.

This approach extends **rational cubic interpolation** by introducing **shape parameters** and **scaling factors**, providing greater flexibility in data approximation.

##  Features  
 **Shape Preservation** – Ensures monotonicity, positivity, and convexity.  
 **Adaptive Rational Cubic IFS** – More flexible than classical cubic splines.  
 **Efficient Computation** – Automated shape parameter selection.  

##  Problem & Solution  
### ⚠ Problem:  
- Traditional fractal interpolation may distort monotonicity, positivity, or convexity.  
- Manual tuning of parameters is inefficient.

###  Solution:  
- **Trial-and-error tuning** (less precise).  
- **Automated selection of scaling factors and shape parameters** for improved shape preservation.

##  Implementation  
- Define **Iterated Function System (IFS)** for given dataset **\((x_i, f_i)\)**.  
- Compute scaling factors **\(\alpha_i\)** and shape parameters **\(v_i, w_i\)**.  
- Apply **rational cubic FIF** for smooth interpolation.
